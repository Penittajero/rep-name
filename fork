🔹 Step 1: Find the Repository You Want to Fork
Open your browser and go to https://github.com.

Search for the repository you want to fork, or go directly to its URL.

🔹 Step 2: Click the “Fork” Button
On the top right corner of the repo page, click the “Fork” button.

GitHub will ask where you want to fork it (if you're in multiple orgs).

Select your GitHub account (or organization).

💥 After a few seconds, GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account.

🔹 Step 3: Clone the Fork to Your Local Machine (Optional but Common)
In your newly forked repo (under your GitHub profile), click the “Code” button.

Copy the URL (HTTPS or SSH).

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo-name.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd forked-repo-name
✅ Now you have a local copy to work with.

🔹 Step 4: Add the Original Repository as a Remote (Optional)
This helps you pull updates from the original repo later.

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo-name.git
You can verify remotes with:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote -v
🔹 Step 5: Make Changes and Push
Create a new branch (recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
Make your code changes locally.

Add, commit, and push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin my-feature-branch
🔹 Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your forked repo on GitHub.

GitHub will show a “Compare & pull request” button.

Click it, write a description, and submit your pull request to the original repo.

✅ Result:
You now have a forked copy.

You can make changes safely.

You can contribute back by creating a pull request.
