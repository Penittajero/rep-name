 Step-by-Step Process to Create and Address GitHub Issues
🔹 Step 1: Create a New Issue in Your Repository
Go to your GitHub repository using your browser.

Click the “Issues” tab (located near the top of the repo page).

Click the “New issue” button (usually green).

Type a title for the issue (e.g., “Fix login button not working”).

In the description box, explain what the issue is about — give details, screenshots if needed.

Optionally:

Assign it to someone (in the "Assignees" section).

Add labels like “bug,” “enhancement,” etc.

Set a milestone or project if needed.

Click “Submit new issue” — the issue is now live!

✅ This helps track problems or features that need work in the project.

🔹 Step 2: Assign the Issue to a Collaborator
In the issue page, look for the “Assignees” box on the right side.

Click it and select the collaborator (yourself or your teammate).

That person is now officially responsible for resolving the issue.

✅ They’ll get a notification and can start working on it.

🔹 Step 3: Label the Issue
Still on the issue page, look for the “Labels” section (right side).

Click it to choose appropriate tags like:

bug – Something is broken.

feature – A new feature suggestion.

help wanted – Needs assistance.

You can also create custom labels if needed.

✅ Labels make it easier to organize and filter issues.

🔹 Step 4: Fix the Issue in Code and Close It via Commit Message
In your local code:

Fix the issue in the appropriate file(s).

Open terminal/command prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Fix #1: Corrected login button issue"
Replace #1 with the issue number from GitHub.

Push the code to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
💡 GitHub will automatically detect the Fix #1 in the commit message and close the issue.

✅ This directly links your code change to the issue.

🔹 Step 5 (Optional): Comment and Collaborate
Go to the issue page.

You can add comments like:

Asking for help

Providing progress updates

Clarifying the issue

Use @username to tag team members.

Add screenshots, logs, or attachments for better understanding.
