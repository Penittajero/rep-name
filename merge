Alright! Let's go very very very clearly step by step — like you're doing it for the first time.


---

Goal:

You want to bring the latest updates from main branch into your own branch (example: feature-branch).


---

Step-by-step:

1. Open Terminal (or Git Bash)

Where you have your Git project.


---

2. Make sure you saved your work

Before switching branches, save any work you've done.

git status

If you see changes not committed, do this:

git add .
git commit -m "Saving my work before merging"


---

3. Switch to your branch

Let’s say your branch is called feature-branch.

git checkout feature-branch

Now you are working inside feature-branch.


---

4. Make sure the main branch is up to date

You want to bring the latest code from main. So do this:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

This gets the latest code from GitHub.


---

5. Now switch back to your branch again

git checkout feature-branch


---

6. Merge main into your branch

Now run this:

git merge main

If everything is fine, Git will say:

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

If there is a conflict, Git will show a message and you'll have to fix the files manually.


---

7. After merge, push your changes to GitHub

git push origin feature-branch


---

That's it!

You have now merged main into your branch very clearly and safely.
